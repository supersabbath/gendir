Database

From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia

A database is an organized collection of data for one or more purposes usually in digital form The data are typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality for example the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports processes requiring this information for example finding a hotel with vacancies This definition is very general and is independent of the technology used
The term database may be narrowed to specify particular aspects of organized collection of data and may refer to the logical database to physical database as data content in computer data storage or to many other database subdefinitions
The term database is correctly applied to the data and their supporting data structures and not to the database managemen
t system referred to by the acronym DBMS The database data collection with DBMS is called a database system
The term database system implies that the data is managed to some level of quality measured in terms of accuracy availability usability and resilience and this in turn often implies the use of a generalpurpose database management system DBMS A generalpurpose DBMS is typically a complex software system that meets many usage requirements and the databases that it maintains are often large and complex The utilization of databases is now spread to such a wide degree that virtually every technology and product relies on databases and DBMSs for its development and commercialization or even may have such embedded in it Also organizations and companies from small to large heavily depend on databases for their operations
Well known DBMSs include Oracle IBM DB2 Microsoft SQL Server PostgreSQL MySQL and SQLite A database is not generally portable across different DBMS but different DBMSs can interoperate to some degree by using standards like SQL and ODBC to support together a single application A DBMS also needs to provide effective runtime execution to properly support eg in terms of performance availability and security as many endusers as needed
The design construction and maintenance of a complex database requires specialist skills the staff performing these functions are referred to as database application programmers and database administrators Their tasks are supported by tools provided either as part of the DBMS or as standalone software products These tools include specialized database languages including data definition languages DDL data manipulation languages DML and query languages These can be seen as specialpurpose programming languages tailored specifically to manipulate databases sometimes they are provided as extensions of existing programming languages with added database commands Database languages are generally specific to one data model and in many cases they are specific to one DBMS type The most widely supported database language is SQL which has been developed for the relational data model and combines the roles of both DDL DML and a query language
A way to classify databases involves the type of their contents for example bibliographic documenttext statistical or multimedia objects Another way is by their application area for example accounting music compositions movies banking manufacturing or insurance
