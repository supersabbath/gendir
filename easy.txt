m engine

From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia

A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid
Steam engines are external combustion engines where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products Noncombustion heat sources such as solar power nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used Water turns to steam in a boiler and reaches a high pressure When expanded through pistons or turbines mechanical work is done The reducedpressure steam is then condensed and it is pumped back into the boiler The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle Some practical steam engines discard the lowpressure steam instead of condensing it for reuse
The idea of using boiling water to produce mechanical motion has a long history going back about 2000 years Early devices were not practical power producers but more advanced designs producing usable power have become a major source of mechanical power over the last 300 years beginning with applications for removing water from mines using vacuum engines Subsequent developments used pressurized steam and converted linear to rotational motion which enabled the powering of a wide range of manufacturing machinery These engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained whereas previous installations were limited to locations where water wheels or windmills could be used Significantly this power source would later be applied to vehicles such as steam tractors and railway locomotives The steam engine was a critical component of the Industrial Revolution providing the prime mover for modern massproduction manufacturing methods Modern steam turbines generate about 90 of the electric power in the United States using a variety of heat sources
In general usage the term steam engine can refer to integrated steam plants such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines or may refer to the machinery alone as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine Specialized devices such as steam hammers and steam pile drivers are dependent on steam supplied from a separate boiler

History

The history of the steam engine stretches back as far as the first century AD the first recorded rudimentary steam engine being the aeolipile described by Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria In the following centuries the few steampowered engines known about were essentially experimental devices used by inventors to demonstrate the properties of steam A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi alDin in 1551 and by Giovanni Branca in 1629
Following the invention by Denis Papin of the steam digester in 1679 and a first piston steam engine in 1690 the first practical steampowered engine was a water pump developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery It proved only to have a limited lift height and was prone to boiler explosions but it still received some use for mines and pumping stations
The first commercially successful engine did not appear until around 1712 Incorporating technologies discovered by Savery and Denis Papin the atmospheric engine invented by Thomas Newcomen paved the way for the Industrial Revolution Newcomens engine was relatively inefficient and in most cases was only used for pumping water It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam in a cylinder and was mainly employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible but also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable head


Early Watt pumping engine
The next major step occurred when James Watt developed 176375 an improved version of Newcomens engine with a separate condenser Watts engine used 75 less coal than Newcomens and was hence much cheaper to run Watt proceeded to develop his engine further modifying it to provide a rotary motion suitable for driving factory machinery This enabled factories to be sited away from rivers and further accelerated the pace of the Industrial Revolution
Newcomens and Watts early engines were atmospheric meaning that they were powered by the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam instead of the pressure of expanding steam Cylinders had to be large as the only usable force acting on them was atmospheric pressure Steam was only used to compensate for the atmosphere allowing the piston to move back to its starting position
Around 1800 Richard Trevithick and separately Oliver Evans 1801 introduced engines using highpressure steam These were much more powerful than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications Thereafter technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller faster or more powerful depending on the intended application
The Corliss steam engine a fourvalve counterflow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves was called the most significant advance in the steam engine since James Watt In addition to using 30 less steam it provided more uniform speed making is well suited to manufacturing especially cotton spinning
The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the switch from pistons to turbines starting in the early part of the 20th century Turbines are more efficient than pistons have fewer moving parts and provide rotative power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means
Steam engines remained the dominant source of power well into the 20th century when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating piston steam engines in commercial usage and the ascendancy of steam turbines in power generation Today most steam power is provided by turbines and piston engines are limited to historical pieces

Steam cycle

The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine The Rankine cycle is a cycle that converts heat into work The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop which in steam engines contains water and steam This cycle generates about 90 of all electric power used throughout the world including virtually all solar thermal biomass coal and nuclear power plants It is named after William John Macquorn Rankine a Scottish polymath
The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because when an efficient turbine is used the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle The main difference is that heat addition in the boiler and rejection in the condenser are isobaric constant pressure in the Rankine cycle and isothermal constant temperature in the theoretical Carnot cycle In this cycle a pump is also used to pressurize the working fluid received from the condenser as a liquid instead of as a gas Pumping the working fluid through the cycle as a liquid requires a very small fraction of the energy needed to transport it as compared to compressing the working fluid as a gas in a compressor as in the Carnot cycle
The working fluid in a Rankine cycle follows a closed loop and is reused constantly While many substances could be used in the Rankine cycle water is usually the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties such as nontoxic and unreactive chemistry abundance and low cost as well as its thermodynamic properties
It is also useful to introduce the historical measure of a steam engines energy efficiency its duty The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier Newcomen designs Duty is the number of footpounds of work delivered by burning one bushel 94 pounds of coal The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million but most were closer to 5 million Watts original lowpressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million but averaged about 17 This was a threefold improvement over the average Newcomen design Early Watt engines equipped with highpressure steam improved this to 65 million
